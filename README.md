# mealTrainingApp
Application to track meals and training

Still somewhat of WIP...

To start using this app, just clone the repository, install requirements (suggested to use venv ofc....) and start the app (app.py)

Feel free to send suggestions if you have them.... If I get decide to fill ingedients list with macros and kcal in the future, I might upload starter DB with bunch of ingredients, but likely this won't happen, because I will not add multi language support and I have my ingredients in Estonian.
